# 💻 Skill: Coding Common Standards

## 🚦 Mandatory Bootstrapping

You have ingested the target source code. Before implementing changes, you MUST load the specific evaluation constraints and implementation rules based on the environment scoring and your mission.

Use your file-reading tool to ingest the applicable directive files:

### 1. Mandatory Clean Code Enforcement

**Always Read:**

- `skills/coding-common/docs/01-clean-code-standard.md`
- `skills/coding-common/docs/02-refactoring-standard.md`

- Focus: Naming conventions, architectural patterns (SOLID/DRY), and local style mirroring.
- Action: You are required to refactor any existing "bad code" encountered in the files you are modifying.

### 2. Conditional Unit Testing Protocol

**Condition:** If `INTERNAL_TEST_MANDATORY` is `TRUE` (test count $\ge 5$ OR explicitly requested).
**Action:** You MUST invoke the system tool: `activate_skill("unit-testing")`.

- Focus: Test coverage, edge case validation, and matching existing testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Mocha, etc.).

## 🛠️ Global Execution Constraints

1. **Zero Hallucination:** If you cannot find a required dependency or function, you MUST report a "Logic Gap" instead of guessing.
2. **Actionability:** Every implementation must be production-ready. No placeholders.

Do NOT proceed with the implementation until the required sub-documents have been fully internalized.
